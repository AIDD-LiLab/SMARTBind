# Make predictions with SmartBind

## Virtual Screening
Please refer to `virtual_screening.ipynb`. It requires a RNA sequence and a list of 
small molecules in SMILES format. It outputs sorted predictions of the top potential molecule candidates.

## Binding sites prediction
Please refer to `binding_site_prediction.ipynb`. It requires a RNA sequence and a small molecule in SMILES format.
It outputs normalized residue-level binding scores.
